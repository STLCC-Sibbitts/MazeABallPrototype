Version 1
Core build with sort-of-working board controller script.
Version 2.1 
Added physics materials and tried to squash any bugs in the board controller script.
Version 2.2
-Physics have been upgraded
-Board Controller script makes more sense.... Cleaned up and clearer in its intent.
-Added textures to ball and board.
Version 2.3
-Fine tuned all of the game's moving pieces: Board Maximum Angle, Speed, angular drag on all materials, physics, and downward vertical force on the  ball.
-Sidewalls added, although they need a slightly better configuration.
-Renamed and commented all scripts.
-Adjusted the game objects to match their prefabs. Remeber: anytime a new script needs to be added, attach it to the prefab of that object, not the object that's currently in the game feild.
-Adjusted the textures and mesh layers of ball and board.
Version PROTOTYPE
-Cleaned up for GitHub Upload.
-Removed old artifacts and solutions left over from previous versions
-This is now the most current, working solution.
